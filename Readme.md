# Ray Marching Engine ALPHA V0.01
## About
This is a ray marching based game engine I am building to learn how to build game engines and OpenGL programs.
I have not worked on it in a while and it does not function as a game engine yet.

This is very closely based on:

[Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)  
[Dist Functions](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/)  
[An Introduction To Raymarching @ Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khblXafu7iA)
